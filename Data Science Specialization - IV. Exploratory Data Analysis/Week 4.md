## Clustering Case Study
	
	The basic idea of exploratory data analysis is you want to kind of produce a rough cut of the analysis that you ultimately maybe want to do. So maybe this isn't going to be perfect but it's going to give you a rough idea of what information you're going to be able to extract out of your data set and what kinds of questions you're going to be able to feasibly answer and, and what questions might not really be possible to answer with the given data set. So, exploratory data analysis is really important because it rules out certain questions, and it kind of pushes you along other directions.
